This is for in-class exercise of MIT 6.828 course.(http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/)
For original "README" file, I rename it to README-xv6.

Each branch contains the code for each exercise, eg. branch lec8 contains code
and revision for exercise in lecture 8. Especially, branch "comments" contains
notes and commentary for xv6 source code, taken by myself.

Those branches do not contain this README file, for historical reason...

Thanks for people who design and implement 6.828. I learn a lot.
